This repository contains the implementation of sorting features for arrays using Java. It includes two main features:

- **Feature 1**: Sorting an array of integers.
- **Feature 2**: Sorting an array of strings.

## Features

### Feature 1: Sorting Integers
- **Description**: This feature provides a function to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
- **Usage**:
  - The main class for this feature is `Feature1` (`feature1.java`), located in the `src/com/feature1/` package.
  - To use this feature, run the `main()` method in `feature1.java`, which allows the user to enter an array of integers to be sorted.
- **How to Run**:
  1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  2. Navigate to the directory and run `feature1.java` in your IDE.
  3. You will be prompted to enter the number of elements and then the elements themselves.
  4. The sorted output will be displayed.

### Feature 2: Sorting Strings
- **Description**: This feature provides a function to sort an array of strings in ascending alphabetical order.
- **Usage**:
  - The main class for this feature is `Feature2` (`feature2.java`), located in the `src/com/feature2/` package.
  - Run the `main()` method in `feature2.java` to input an array of strings and view the sorted result.
- **How to Run**:
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Open `feature2.java` in your IDE.
  3. Enter the strings to be sorted when prompted.
